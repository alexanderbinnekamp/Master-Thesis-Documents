at the same time that it has made financial mechanisms available to them to undertake the necessary investments for the improvement of the Spanish productive fabric .',\n 'To date- the maximum coverage percentage of the guarantees granted has been 80%.',\n 'This is a balanced decision from the financial point of view: while granting a significant safety net to financial institutions to encourage the granting of credit - it is guaranteed that they carry out a solid risk analysis - since they continue assuming part of the credit risk.',\n 'However, the tourism sector, hospitality and related activities are especially suffering from the effects of the pandemic.',\n 'The international restrictions on mobility have caused tourist arrivals to be reduced very intensely, so that until October 17-9 million international tourists had visited our country - compared to the 74-7 million who arrived during the first ten months of 2019.',\n 'As a consequence - the total expenditure of foreign tourists in the first ten months of 2019 has been reduced by 77-3% compared to the same period of the previous year.',\n 'In this sense - the tourism sectors - such as travel agency activities or accommodation services maintain more than 50% of workers in ERTE - as well as food and beverage services or recreational activities that also - today - maintain approximately 30% and 20% of their workforces-respectively- in ERTE.',\n 'Similarly - the COVID-19 Guarantee Line implemented through the ICO in order to contribute to the liquidity of the system has approved until the beginning of December 918,673 operations aimed mainly at SMEs and the self-employed - for a value of 85,079 million euros - which have made it possible to inject a volume of financing of 111,975 million - concentrated in the most affected sectors: the group made up of commerce-transport and hospitality has received the largest volume of financing (47,871 million euros) - followed by industry (24,664 million) .',\n 'In addition- tourism is a key sector for the Spanish economy.',\n 'According to the INE Tourism Satellite Account- in 2019, tourism activities contributed 12-4% of GDP and 12-9% of employment.',\n 'For this reason- this Agreement of the Council of Ministers extends exceptionally and only for the sectors related to hospitality and tourism up to 90% the maximum percentage of coverage of the guarantees destined to the financing of investments and liquidity needs of the companies. SMEs and freelancers- for a total maximum amount of 500 million euros.',\n 'In this way - the Temporary Framework for State Aid of the European Union is fully respected - taking full advantage of the opportunities it offers.',\n 'On the other hand - with the aim of continuing to support SMEs - this Agreement of the Council of Ministers releases a new tranche amounting to 500 million euros to reinforce the guarantee granted by CERSA - thus increasing the guarantee capacity of the Reciprocal Guarantee- present in all the Autonomous Communities of Spain and with great capillarity as reinforcers of access to financing for SMEs in the different geographical areas in which they are present.',\n 'This new tranche goes further than the first tranche released in favor of CERSA -

correspond.',\n 'Such operations could continue to be classified as normal risk as long as the entity justifies not having identified a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition.',\n 'The first transitory provision establishes that the entities will adapt - when necessary - their accounting methodologies, procedures and practices to apply the modifications

COVID-19 or once this situation is overcome).',\n 'The prospective application of the amendment implies that the entities will not have to review either the classification or the credit risk coverage

the common administrative procedure of Public Administrations.',\n 'Regarding the principles of necessity and effectiveness stipulated in said law - this circular is limited to introducing the necessary modifications in annex 9 - on \"Analysis and coverage of credit risk\" - of Circular 4/2017 - of November 27 - so that restructured-refinanced or refinancing operations do not necessarily have to be classified as normal risk under special surveillance when their classification as doubtful risk does not correspond- thus allowing entities to make greater use of the flexibility provided for in the EBA Guidelines/ GL/2017/06.',\n 'In this way - it is easier for entities to grant new financing or change the contractual conditions of the financing already granted to companies and households.',\n 'Regarding the principle of proportionality - the modifications introduced in Circular 4/2017 - of November 27 - allow Spanish entities to make greater use of the flexibility provided for in the EBA/GL/2017/06 Guidelines - in terms similar to the entities of other EU countries.',\n 'These amendments relax the requirements for credit risk classification of a specific type of credit operations, so that entities would not have to change their accounting practices if they do not consider it appropriate to refute the presumption that these operations should be classified as normal risk in special surveillance.',\n 'Regarding the principles of legal certainty and administrative efficiency - they are achieved by prescribing Circular 4/2017 - of November 27 - a stable accounting regulation - predictable - complete and clear for entities.',\n 'The modifications introduced by this circular represent a greater alignment with the provisions of the EBA/GL/2017/06 Guidelines- maintaining compatibility with IFRS-EU 9.',\n 'In application of the principle of transparency - sections 1 and 2 of article 133 of Law 39/2015 - of October 1 - on Common Administrative Procedure - provide for prior public consultation - hearing and public information.',\n 'However- the paragraph4 of the aforementioned article 133 contemplates the possibility of dispensing with said procedures when there are serious reasons of public interest that justify it - as well as dispensing with prior consultation when the regulatory proposal does not have a significant impact on economic activity - does not impose obligations relevant to recipients or regulate partial aspects of a subject.',\n 'During the processing of this circular, consultation procedures have been dispensed with - hearing and public information - in the first place - because there is a particularly serious public interest that justifies it.',\n 'Given the public health emergency situation - and its exceptional economic effects - the immediate entry into force of the regulation is necessary - to contribute as soon as possible to maintaining financing for the real economy - mitigating the disturbances that the economy is experiencing Spanish.',\n 'Secondly - this circular does not impose any additional obligation on entities on how to classify their credit operations.',\n 'On the contrary - it makes the application of the rule more flexible by allowing them now to refute the presumption that certain credit operations should be classified as normal risk under special surveillance.',\n 'In fact - entities may maintain their current accounting practices if they consider it appropriate not to rebut such a presumption.',\n 'Thirdly - the modification introduced by this circular is limited to a specific aspect - giving greater flexibility - without causing a change in the accounting regime.',\n 'The Bank of Spain is empowered to establish and modify the accounting standards of credit institutions - in accordance with the provisions of the Order of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of March 31, 1989 - which empowers the Bank of Spain to establish and modify the accounting standards of credit

27: a) Point 24- is modified, which is worded in the following terms: «24.',\n 'The refinancing and restructuring policies must ensure that the entity has in its internal information system mechanisms that allow proper identification and monitoring of refinancing operations - refinanced and restructured - as well as their adequate accounting classification based on their risk of credit.',\n 'The decisions adopted will be reviewed periodically in order to verify the proper compliance with the refinancing and restructuring policies.',\n 'An operation will no longer be identified as refinancing-refinanced or restructured when the requirements of point 100 are met.',\n 'However - in accordance with the principle of traceability set forth in point 45 - the entity's internal information system must keep the information on the modification made - necessary to ensure adequate monitoring, evaluation and control of the operation at all times .» b) Point 58- is amended to read as follows: «58.',\n 'The coverage of all the operations for which an individualized estimate does not have to be made will be subject to a collective estimate.',\n 'Therefore- the coverage of the following operations will be subject to collective estimation: a) Those classified as doubtful due to delinquency (other than those that were identified as having low credit risk) that are not considered significant- including those classified as doubtful risk due to delinquency due to the accumulation of amounts due in other operations with the same holder.',\n 'b) Operations classified as doubtful for reasons other than delinquency (other than those that were identified as having low credit risk) considering exclusively automatic classification factors- such as in the cases of: i. Refinancing operations - refinanced or restructured that do not have amounts past due more than ninety days but remain classified as doubtful risk because the remaining requirements for their reclassification out of this category are not verified - in accordance with the provisions of point 120 .ii.',\n 'Refinancing-refinanced or restructured operations in trial period reclassified to doubtful risk for being subject to the second or subsequent re-financing or restructuring- or due to overdue amounts more than thirty days old- in accordance with the provisions of point 102. c) Those classified as normal under special surveillance that are not considered significant.',\n 'd) Those classified as normal under special surveillance as a result of an individual analysis of the operation in which automatic factors have been considered exclusively or in which no factor other than automatic factors has had a decisive influence.',\n 'This is the case - among others - of operations classified in this category because the holder has amounts overdue for more than thirty days - in accordance with the provisions of point 95. e) Those classified as normal under special surveillance by its belonging to a group of operations with similar credit risk characteristics (\"homogeneous risk group\").',\n 'This is the case -among others- of the groups of operations classified in this category due to the holder's belonging to groups (such as geographical areas or sectors of economic activity) in which weaknesses are observed.',\n 'f) Those classified as normal risk.» c) In point 99 - the first paragraph is modified - which is worded in the terms set out below - and the fourth paragraph is deleted: «99.',\n 'Operations classified in this category may be reclassified to normal risk if the causes that led to their classification as normal risk in special surveillance disappear.',\n 'In general, the criteria for reclassification from normal under special supervision to normal when a favorable evolution of credit risk occurs must be consistent with those that determine the reverse reclassification when an unfavorable evolution occurs.',\n 'However, this coherence should be applied only to the extent that the analyzed criterion represents a reversal of the significant increase in credit risk.» d) Section II.B.2 - entitled \"Refinancing-refinanced or restructured operations classified as normal risk under special surveillance\"- is renamed \"Refinancing-refinanced or restructured operations other than those classified as doubtful risk\".',\n 'e) Item 100- is amended to read as follows: «100.',\n 'Refinancing-refinanced or restructured operations for which classification as doubtful is not appropriate on the date of refinancing or restructuring-in accordance with the provisions of points 115 and 116- or because they have been reclassified from the category of doubtful risk- by complying with the provisions of point 120 for their reclassification - they will remain identified as such - during a trial period - until all the following requirements are met: a) It has been concluded - after an exhaustive review of the patrimonial and financial situation of the holder - that it is not foreseeable that it may have financial difficulties.',\n 'b) A minimum period of two years has elapsed from the date of formalization of the refinancing or restructuring operation -or- if later- from the date of reclassification from the doubtful risk category.',\n 'c) That the holder has paid the accrued installments of principal and interest from the date on which the refinancing or restructuring operation was formalized-or-if later-from the date of reclassification from the doubtful category.',\n 'Additionally- it will be necessary: ​​i.

consists of an expository part and an operative part, and is structured in two chapters comprising five articles and two final provisions.',\n 'The first chapter comprises the first-second and third articles.',\n 'In the first article, the seventh additional provision of Law 9/2012- of November 14- is modified for the purposes of non-application to SAREB of the provisions of article 363.1.e) of the consolidated text of the Companies Law of Capital- approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010- of July 2.',\n 'The second article modifies Law 1/2013 - of May 14 - extends the term and the group benefited from the suspension of launches.',\n 'In this sense - the validity of the suspension of releases is extended for four more years for people who are in cases of special vulnerability when in a judicial or extrajudicial process of foreclosure the home had been awarded to any person - not only to the creditor or to a third party acting on his behalf- as was the case in the amended text.',\n 'At the same time- included among the vulnerable groups are familiessingle-parent families with only one dependent child.',\n 'Lastly - increases the income limit to be able to benefit from the measure - by increasing it for each dependent child within the family unit by 0-15 times the IPREM for single-parent families or by 0-10 times the IPREM for the rest of families.',\n 'The third article modifies Royal Decree 84/2015 - of February 13 - expanding the type of financial entities already constituted that can request their transformation into banks.',\n 'For its part- the second chapter is constituted by the fourth article and the fifth article.',\n 'In the fourth article, the Organic Law 3/1986 - of April 14 - on Special Measures in Public Health Matters is modified to establish the centralized supply by the State of health products other than medicines.',\n 'Finally - the fifth article contemplates - in order to protect public health - as a situation assimilated to an accident at work exclusively for the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system the periods of isolation or contagion of the workers as a consequence of the COVID-19 virus.',\n 'The first final provision maintains the range of the modifications made in Royal Decree 84/2015 - of February 13 - allowing them to be modified by royal decree in the future.',\n 'The second final provision includes -for its part- the entry into force.',\n 'VI The adoption of measures of an economic nature by royal decree-law has been endorsed by the Constitutional Court provided that there is an explicit and reasoned motivation of the need –understanding as such that the economic situation requires a rapid response– and the urgency –assuming as such that the delay in the time of the adoption of the measure in question through a procedure through the ordinary regulatory channel could generate some damage–.',\n 'The royal decree-law constitutes a constitutionally lawful instrument - provided that the purpose that justifies the emergency legislation - is - as our Constitutional Court has repeatedly demanded (sentences 6/1983- of February 4- F. 5; 11/ 2002- January 17- F. 4- 137/2003- July 3- F. 3 and 189/2005- July 7- F. 3)- meet a specific situation- within the government objectives- that For reasons that are difficult to foresee, it requires immediate regulatory action in a shorter period than that required by the normal route or by the urgent procedure for the parliamentary processing of laws - especially when the determination of said procedure does not depend on the Government.',\n 'As has been stated, in this case there are circumstances of extraordinary and urgent need that justify the approval of this royal decree-law required by article 86.1 of the Spanish Constitution.',\n 'At the present time it is still necessary to face the situation of those families that continue to suffer economic adversity - which justifies the modifications of Law 1/2013 - of May 14.',\n 'The planned term will end on May 15, 2020, so resorting to the royal decree-law as a regulatory vehicle to extend this term for another four years is totally justified.',\n 'Likewise- the lack of adjustment of the vulnerability threshold since the measure was approved in 2012 may be causing the unjustified release of people who would actually be part of this group.',\n 'These circumstances also concur in relation to the introduction of the modification of the seventh additional provision of Law 9/2012- of November 14.',\n 'After a little more than half of the period for which SAREB was created (Royal Decree 1559/2012 - of November 15 - establishes its duration at 15 years - until November 28, 2027) and taking into account the degree of divestment achieved At the present time - and given the risks arising from a market such as real estate with a certain degree of volatility - it is necessary to prevent SAREB from eventually finding itself in a legal cause of dissolution - which would prevent the normal development of its activity and- in short, fully achieve the objectives for which the company was created.',\n 'And - in particular - the social housing promotion program that it plans to develop in the short term - whose development and implementation has a marked social interest in the current real estate market situation - could be frustrated.',\n 'The causes of extraordinary and urgent need also concur in the new regime established by the third article - which allows an orderly transformation and expansion of the activities of certain financial entities and branches in Spain in the face of the risk of lack of agreement on future relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.',\n 'This provision equalizes the regime of transformation into banks of credit cooperatives- stablefinancial foundations of credit - securities companies - payment institutions and electronic money institutions.',\n 'The current economic situation with strong competition to attract investment and companies in the context of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union requires immediate action.',\n 'The processing of this provision through ordinary legislative channels would mean placing the Spanish financial system at a disadvantage in a context with risks and opportunities compared to neighboring countries.',\n 'The United Kingdom is - furthermore - the first destination of our foreign direct investment - highly concentrated in the financial sector - so its withdrawal could significantly affect our financial system.',\n 'Regarding the fourth and fifth articles of this royal decree-law- in the current scenario of containment and prevention of COVID-19, it is urgent and necessary to stop the epidemic and prevent its spread to protect public health and the current lack of definition sick leave due to isolation or contagion for the purposes of social economic benefits - as it is detrimental to citizens and a risk to public health.',\n 'Likewise - it has been detected that the shortage of products necessary for the protection of health constitutes a risk to public health - it should be noted that there are health reasons that justify the urgent and extraordinary need provided for in article 86.1 of our Constitution - which support the planned modification of the fourth article of the Organic Law 3/1986- of April 14.',\n 'Likewise- the extraordinary and urgent need to approve this royal decree-law is part of the impeachment or opportunity trial that corresponds to the Government (SSTC 61/2018- of June 7- FJ 4; 142/2014- of September 11 - FJ 3) and this decision - without a doubt - supposes an ordering of political priorities for action (STC of January 30, 2019- Unconstitutionality Appeal no.',\n '2208-2019) - focused on compliance with legal certainty - the protection of especially vulnerable groups in our society and public health.',\n 'The reasons of opportunity that have just been exposed show that - in no case - this royal decree-law constitutes an assumption of abusive or arbitrary use of this constitutional instrument (SSTC 61/2018- of June 7- FJ 4; 100/ 2012- May 8- FJ 8; 237/2012- December 13- FJ 4; 39/2013- February 14- FJ 5).',\n 'On the contrary - all the reasons stated justify the adoption of this standard (SSTC 29/1982- of May 31- FJ 3; 111/1983- of December 2- FJ 5; 182/1997- of 20 October- FJ 3).',\n 'It should also be noted that this royal decree-law does not affect the ordering of the basic institutions of the State - the rights, duties and freedoms of citizens regulated in Title I of the Constitution - the regime of the Autonomous Communities or electoral law general.',\n 'The reasons set out fully justify the concurrence of the constitutional requirements of extraordinary and urgent need- that enable the Government to approve this royal decree-law within the margin of appreciation that- as a political management body of the State- recognizes article 86.1 of the Constitution.',\n 'There are also notes of exceptionality - seriousness and relevance that make immediate normative action necessary in a shorter period than that required for the parliamentary processing of a law - either by ordinary procedure or by urgency (SSTC 68/2007 - FJ 10- and 137/2011- FJ 7).',\n 'VII This royal decree-law responds to the principles of necessity-effectiveness-proportionality-legal certainty-transparency-and efficiency- as required by Law 39/2015- of October 1- of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations. ',\n 'As far as the principles of necessity and effectiveness are concerned - this royal decree-law is the optimal instrument to maintain the level of protection of mortgage debtors who are in a situation of vulnerability who - given the impossibility of fulfilling their obligations payment - were sued by their creditors and were stripped of their home ownership.',\n 'In effect - in all these cases - the need for them to continue living in what was their home makes it essential that the suspension of launches be extended and the vulnerability threshold be adjusted.',\n 'Furthermore - it is also the optimal instrument in relation to the modification of the seventh additional provision of Law 9/2012 - of November 14 - given that it is necessary to achieve the fundamental objective of SAREB.',\n 'Finally - it is also in relation to the modification of the fourth additional provision of Royal Decree 84/2015 - of February 13 - since it is necessary to eliminate an idiosyncratic obstacle of the regulationsa national that makes it difficult to transform into banks - which has become an element of competitiveness in a global context.',\n 'The need and effectiveness of the modification of the Organic Law 3/1986 - of April 14 - is revealed to the extent that it has been detected that the shortage of products necessary for the protection of health constitutes a risk to public health in the current scenario of containment and prevention of COVID-19 and a specific and specific measure is proposed to alleviate this situation.',\n 'Lastly- through this regulatory mechanism, the need to exceptionally assimilate as an accident at work the periods of isolation or contagion of working people as a result of the COVID-19 virus can be met for the purpose of enjoying the economic benefit. of temporary incapacity of the Social Security system.',\n 'Regarding the principle of proportionality - it is a specific modification - precise and clear of five aspects that respectively require immediate regulatory action in order to guarantee the protection of vulnerable groups - the maintenance of SAREB's activity - the orderly transformation of the activities of financial entities in the context of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union and guaranteeing public health in the context generated by COVID-19 through the best possible alternative.',\n 'It should also be noted that - respecting the principle of proportionality - with regard to the modification of Royal Decree 84/2015 - of February 13 - it has been chosen precisely to modify the royal decree instead of raising the rank - carrying out the essential minimum alteration of the current regime in which said royal decree is the one that regulates the most substantive aspects of the authorization of credit institutions.',\n 'Regarding the principle of legal security - this royal decree-law establishes the minimum essential regulation for the fulfillment of its purposes - it is consistent with the rest of the legal system - both national - and the European Union and does not impose unnecessary administrative burdens or accessories.',\n 'The changes introduced in the regulations on credit institutions and the protection of mortgage debtors make it possible to generate a stable, integrated and clear regulatory framework.',\n 'Regarding the principle of transparency - the rule is exempt from the procedures of public consultation - hearing and public information that are not applicable to the processing and approval of decree-laws.',\n 'Lastly - in relation to the principle of efficiency - this royal decree-law does not impose any administrative burden additional to those previously existing.',\n 'By virtue - making use of the authorization contained in article 86 of the Spanish Constitution - at the proposal of the Third Vice President of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation - and of the Ministers of Health and Inclusion - Social Security and Migration and after deliberation by the Council of Ministers at its meeting on March 10, 2020- I ORDER: CHAPTER I Measures in economic matters Article one.',\n 'Modification of Law 9/2012- of November 14- on restructuring and resolution of credit institutions.',\n 'Section 3 of the seventh additional provision of Law 9/2012- of November 14- is worded as follows: «3.',\n 'This company will be incorporated for a limited period of time - which will be determined by regulation - and the provisions of articles 348 bis and 363.1.e) of the Capital Companies Law will not apply to it.',\n 'Furthermore- regulations may determine or- where appropriate- attribute to the FROB the determination of the initial amount of share capital and the issue premium.» Second article.',\n 'Modification of Law 1/2013- of May 14- on measures to reinforce the protection of mortgage debtors- debt restructuring and social rent.',\n 'One.',\n 'The first paragraph of section 1 of article 1 of Law 1/2013- of May 14- is worded as follows: «1.',\n 'Until eleven years have elapsed from the entry into force of this Law- the launch will not proceed when in a judicial or extrajudicial process of foreclosure the creditor- or any other natural or legal person has been awarded the habitual residence of people who are in cases of special vulnerability and in the economic circumstances provided for in this article.” Two.',\n 'The letter b) of section 2 of article 1 of Law 1/2013- of May 14- is worded as follows: «b) Single-parent family unit with at least one dependent child.» Three.',\n 'Letter a) of section 1 of article 3 of Law 1/2013- of May 14- is worded as follows: «a) That the total income of the members of the family unit does not exceed the limit of three times the annual Public Indicator of Multiple Effects Income of fourteen payments.',\n 'Said limit will be four times the Public Indicator of Income for Multiple Effects annually of fourteen payments in the cases provided for in letters d) and f) of the previous section- and five times said indicator in the event that the executed is a person with cerebral palsy - with mental illness or intellectual disability - with a recognized degree of disability equal to or greater than 33 percent - or person with physical or sensory disability - with a recognized degree of disability equal to or greater than 65 percent - as well as in cases of serious illness that accreditedly incapacitate the person or their caregiver to carry out a work activity.',\n 'The limit defined for each case will be increased for each dependent child within the family unit by: i.',\n '0-15 times the IPREM for single-parent families; ii.',\n '0-10 times the IPREM for the rest of the families.' Third article.',\n 'Modification of Royal Decree 84/2015- of February 13- which develops Law 10/2014- of June 26- on organization-supervision and solvency of credit institutions.',\n 'The fourth additional provision of Royal Decree 84/2015- of February 13 is worded as follows: «Fourth additional provision.',\n 'Authorization for the transformation of already established companies into banks.',\n 'The authorization for transformation into a bank may be granted to already established companies only in the case of credit cooperatives - financial credit establishments - securities companies - payment institutions and electronic money institutions.',\n 'In order to obtain the authorization, it will be necessary to meet the requirements set forth in title I - chapter I of this royal decree - but in relation to article 4.b) - it will be understood that it has been fulfilled provided that the sum of the net worth resulting from the balance sheet corresponding to the year prior to the transformation request - which will necessarily have to be audited - and of the cash contributions reach 18 million euros.',\n 'Furthermore- the authorization may waive compliance with the temporary limitations provided for in article 8.» CHAPTER II Measures for the protection of public health Article four.',\n 'Modification of Organic Law 3/1986- of April 14- on Special Measures in Public Health Matters.',\n 'The fourth article of the Organic Law 3/1986- of April 14- of Special Measures in the Matter of Public Health- is modified, which is worded as follows: «Fourth article.',\n 'When a medicine - a health product or any product necessary for the protection of health is affected by exceptional supply difficulties and to guarantee its best distribution - the State Health Administration - temporarily - may: a) Establish centralized supply by the administration.',\n 'b) Condition its prescription to the identification of risk groups - performance of analytical and diagnostic tests - completion of protocols - sending information to the health authority on the course of treatment or other similar particularities.» Article five.',\n 'Exceptional consideration as a situation assimilated to an accident at work during periods of isolation-contagion or restriction on leaving the municipality where workers have their domicile or workplace as a result of the COVID-19 virus.',\n 'one.',\n 'In order to protect public health - those periods of isolation or contagion of workers caused by the COVID-19 virus- unless it is proven that the contagion of the disease has been contracted with exclusive cause in the performance of the work in the terms indicated in article 156 of the consolidated text of the General Social Security Law- approved by the Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015- of October 30- in which case it will be classified as a work accident.',\n 'With the same exceptional character -
